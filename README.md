Overview
---
* The goal of the game is to graduate with the highest GPA possible.

* It takes 4 years to graduate and 3 game modes per year. So you will play 12 different levels to graduate.

* Game Mode 1 is a classic 2D platformer. The goal is to get to the end as quickly as possible.
Picking up books increases GPA, getting hit by enemies reduces GPA.

* Game Mode 2 is an overhead obstacle dodge. The goal is to get to your next class as quickly as possible.
Hitting the other students slows you down.

* Game Mode 3 is another obstacle dodge/pick up tokens. You are taking the test in a classroom filled with teachers.
The goal here is to go around the classroom and pick up every test from other students. The teachers have vision triangles which 
you need to dodge, and once all the tests have been picked the year is finished. The process repeats from the first game mode until
4th year is reached, and the final GPA is calculated.
